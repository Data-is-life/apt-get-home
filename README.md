# Apt-Get-Home: Home recommendation and valuation #

Extracting data from popular real estate websites to determine the value of the features in homes to predict the value of homes and the time it would take to sell the home. Once the data for the properties are extracted, using NLP to extract hidden features from description and property tax records to fully feature each home. Also, recommending users properties based on the home they really like.

## The Problem & Solution: ##

### The Problem:
Anyone looking to buy a home has a hard time putting all the features they desire into any website to search for homes and explaining to their agent. Also, people looking for the valuation of their home could be confused by all the websites giving different prices. The websites don't explain how they come up with the value and which properties and features they use. 

### My Solution:
My model will take features from the home link or address they put in and will give the user only 2 properties a day that is active on the market and matches the most features of that home. Also, anyone looking to get a value for their home will do the same, but will give users options of choosing which features their property has to calculate their home value and if they are looking to sell, the amount of time it will take to sell.
